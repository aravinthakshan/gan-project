The goal of our project is to develop a GAN-based model for face completion. Face completion involves
generating the missing parts of a face given an incomplete image. We have implemented a Deep Convolutional
GAN (DCGAN) architecture, which is particularly well-suited for this task due to its ability to capture spatial
hierarchies and generate high-resolution images.
